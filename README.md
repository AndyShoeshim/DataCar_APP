# DataCar_APP

This application was created for a university project and serves as the front-end of the project. In order to use this project on your PC, you need to follow these steps:
1. Run the local server on your PC (you can find it in my github)
2. After the web server is running locally on your pc, activate the hotspot mode and see the IP address (es. 192.168.13.1).
3. Change the ip address in the build config field with one matching the ip found in the step before.
4. Connect the smartphone to the hotspot network and run the app! 


Technologies used: Retrofit, Recycle View, a little bit of product flavour and more graphical things (like cardview etc.)
